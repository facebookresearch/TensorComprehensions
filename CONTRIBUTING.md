## Automatic formatting

Format your contributed changes with clang-format (using the provided
.clang-format configuration: `clang-format -style=file -i file_to_format`).

This can be done automatically by installing the following pre-commit hook
```sh
#!/bin/sh
git diff-index --cached --name-only HEAD | grep -v .md | grep -v third-party | grep -v .txt | grep -v .sh | xargs ./third-party-install/clang+llvm/bin/clang-format -i -style=file
git diff-index --cached --name-only HEAD | xargs git add
```
Paste this code into `./.git/hooks/pre-commit` and run `chmod +x ./.git/hooks/pre-commit`.
**Note:** this will reformat add re-stage all files that you are about to
commit. Even if you cancel the commit (i.e. by supplying an empty commit
message), the staged files will remain formatted.
More info on [git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hook).

Alternatively, you can use [clang's
git-clang-format.py](https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/trunk/tools/clang-format/git-clang-format)
to format all files that were touched before committing.

Another alternative is to use the provided script:
```
CLANG=${PATH_TO_CLANG_INSTALL_BINARY}/clang-format ./check_and_fix_format.sh
```

## Changes to isl submodule

If you update the isl submodule, then you will typically also need
to update the C++ bindings in isl_interface.
To generate these bindings, you need to build with `WITH_BINDINGS=ON`.
