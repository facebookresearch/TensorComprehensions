Installation Guide
==================

    .. note::

       Since Tensor Comprehensions is still a research project in its infancy
       it is recommended to build the master from source.

Conda installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can install the latest released package for tensor comprehensions as follows:

    .. code-block:: bash

       conda install -y -c pytorch -c tensorcomp tensor_comprehensions

Build from source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    .. note::

       **In order to uniformize and simplify the build system we had to make
       choices. TC is currently only officially supported on Ubuntu 16.04 with
       gcc 5.4.0 and takes most its dependencies from conda packages.**
       Other configurations may work too but are not yet officially supported.
       For more information about the setup we use to build the conda
       dependencies see the following `Dockerfile <https://github.com/facebookresearch/TensorComprehensions/blob/master/conda_recipes/docker-images/tc-cuda9.0-cudnn7.1-ubuntu16.04-devel/Dockerfile>`_.
       Our main goal with this decision is to make the build procedure
       extremely simple, both reproducible internally and extensible to new
       targets in the future. In particular the gcc-4 / gcc-5 ABI switch is
       not something we want to concern ourselves with at this point, we go
       for gcc-5.4.0.

Prerequisites
"""""""""""""
Building TC from source requires gmp, cmake (v3.10 or higher), automake
and libtool. It is generally a good idea to look at the
`Dockerfile <https://github.com/facebookresearch/TensorComprehensions/blob/master/conda_recipes/docker-images/tc-cuda9.0-cudnn7.1-ubuntu16.04-devel/Dockerfile>`_
which shows the environment we use for testing and building our packages.
To install on Ubuntu16.04:

    .. code-block:: bash

       sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev cmake automake libtool

Conda from scratch (first time configuration)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Choose and set an INSTALLATION_PATH then run the following:

    .. code-block:: bash

       wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-5.1.0-Linux-x86_64.sh -O anaconda.sh && \
       chmod +x anaconda.sh && \
       ./anaconda.sh -b -p ${INSTALLATION_PATH} && \
       rm anaconda.sh

       . ${INSTALLATION_PATH}/bin/activate
       conda update -y -n base conda

Create a new environment in which TC will be built and install core dependencies:

    .. code-block:: bash

       conda create -y --name tc_build python=3.6
       conda activate tc_build
       conda install -y pyyaml mkl-include pytest
       conda install -y -c nicolasvasilache llvm-tapir50 halide

Then install the PyTorch version that corresponds to your system binaries
(e.g. cuda 9.0):

    .. code-block:: bash

       conda install -y -c pytorch pytorch torchvision cuda90
       conda remove -y cudatoolkit --force

    .. note::
       As of PyTorch 0.4, PyTorch links cuda libraries dynamically and it
       pulls cudatoolkit. However cudatoolkit can never replace a system installation
       because it cannot package libcuda.so (which comes with the driver, not
       the toolkit). As a consequence cudatoolkit only contains redundant
       libraries and we remove it explicitly. In a near future, the unified
       PyTorch + Caffe2 build system will link everything statically and stop
       pulling the cudatoolkit dependency.

Activate conda in your current terminal
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Once the first time configuration above has been completed, one should
activate conda in
each new terminal window explicitly (it is discouraged to add this to your
`.bashrc` or equivalent)

    .. code-block:: bash

       . ${INSTALLATION_PATH}/bin/activate
       conda activate tc_build

Build TC with dependencies supplied by conda
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

    .. code-block:: bash

       CLANG_PREFIX=$(${CONDA_PREFIX}/bin/llvm-config --prefix) ./build.sh

You may need to pass the environment variable `CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR` pointing
to your cuda installation (this is required for `FindCUDA.cmake` to find your
cuda installation and can be omitted on most systems). When required, passing
`CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/cuda` is generally sufficient.

Test locally
""""""""""""
Run C++ tests:

    .. code-block:: bash

       ./test.sh

Install the TC Python package locally to `/tmp` for smoke checking:

    .. code-block:: bash

       python setup.py install --prefix=/tmp
       export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:$(find /tmp/lib -name site-packages)

Run Python smoke checks:

    .. code-block:: bash

       python -c 'import torch'
       python -c 'import tensor_comprehensions'

Run Python tests:

    .. code-block:: bash

       python ./test_python/test_tc.py -v

At this point, if things work as expected you can venture installing as
follows (it is always a good idea to record installed files for easy removal):

    .. code-block:: bash

       python setup.py install --record tc_files.txt

Advanced / development mode installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Optional dependencies
"""""""""""""""""""""

Optionally if you want to use Caffe2 (this is necessary for building the C++
benchmarks since Caffe2 is our baseline):

    .. code-block:: bash

       conda install -y -c conda-forge eigen
       conda install -y -c nicolasvasilache caffe2

Cudnn version 7.1 in Caffe2 / dev mode
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

    .. note::

       As of PyTorch 0.4, we need to package our own Caffe2. The curent
       PyTorch + Caffe2 build system links cudnn dynamically. The version of
       cudnn that is linked dynamically is imposed on us by the docker image
       supported by NVIDIA (see
       `Dockerfile <https://github.com/facebookresearch/TensorComprehensions/blob/master/conda_recipes/docker-images/tc-cuda9.0-cudnn7.1-ubuntu16.04-devel/Dockerfile>`_).
       For now this cudnn version is cudnn 7.1.

If for some reason, one cannot install cudnn 7.1 system-wide, one may resort
to the following:

    .. code-block:: bash

       conda install -c anaconda cudnn
       conda remove -y cudatoolkit --force

    .. note::

       cudnn pulls a cudatoolkit dependency but this can never replace a
       system installation because it cannot package libcuda.so (which comes
       with the driver, not the toolkit).
       As a consequence cudatoolkit only contains redundant libraries and we
       remove it explicitly. In a near future, the unified PyTorch + Caffe2
       build system will link everything statically and we will not need to
       worry about cudnn anymore.
