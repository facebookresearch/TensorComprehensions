 * Take a simple overapproximation as a convex set and

 * The possibly quasi-affine set is then overapproximated by an affine set.
 * At this point, the set is a possibly infinite, symmetrical interval.
 * Take the maximal value of the difference divided by the stride plus one as
 * a bound on the number of possible values of "f".
 * That is, take M/s + 1.  Note that 0 is always an element of
 * the difference set, so no offset needs to be taken into account
 * during the stride computation and M is an integer multiple of s.
